# Blurifier
## Create interesting layered images (blurs) using this easy-to-use command-line program.

### What is a _**'blur'**_?
![An example of a blur](https://github.com/thegrassisstillgreen/blurifier/blob/master/example_blurs/example_blur_1.jpg "Example 
Blur 1" width = 400)
This is a term I've come up with to describe these layered images. 
Depending on the way you decide to use it, the resulting image can really look like anything, but it is often blurry -- hence 
the name, **blur**.

The blur above was created using 'n' photos, all taken from the window of a Tim Hortons in Toronto, Canada.
Besides altering the brightness, contrast, and the saturation (all from within the Blurifier program), no further edits were 
made to this image.
